#change floor base, at industry level: 
#This regression seems to want one observation per month, so weâ€™d need to create a year-month variable, use 
join_drop %>% group_by(YEAR, MONTH, monthyear) %>% summarize(RetailEmployment = sum(INDNAME == 'Retail Trade'))
# the above is just a starting point for how we could do this. 
#His notes say this from the spec:
"If you want an analysis to be at the industry-month level, you should make your data be at that level too! 
Use mutate(yearmo = year*100 + month) to create a year-month variable, and then use group_by(yearmo, indname) %>% summarize() 
to collapse data to the yearmo/indname level"
